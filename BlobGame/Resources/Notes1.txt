BUGS:
Sometimes clicking doesnt spawn fruit
z order changes wrongly when blobs are combined
make that items are only added to the audio action queue once
blob combining sound is low
blob combining sound is delayed

TODO:
get game to play like the original
scene unloading
clean all references of melba in the files and code to make it generic for multiple themes
back to menu in game scene
blob combining shader
melba popup in main menu
custom music and sound volumes from text file
logger

NICE TO HAVE:
localization
change display settings without restarting => needs gui bounds update
random rotations on spawn
custom physics engine?
apparently cherries and strawberries combine into one when 3 of them collide at once?!
maybe score sync with other players? export as base94 string?
music selection in settings
advance tutorial with keyboard

NAME IDEAS:
Toast
Untitled Toast Game

GAME IDEAS:
speed multiplier for dropping pieces fast
Banana: Strange shaped fruit that combines into a peach (or whatever fruit we change peaches to) when it touches another banana.
Jam: A garbage fruit. The only way to get rid of it is to break the jar on the floor or with another jar. (or maybe a toast slice without jam?)
Egg: Breaks when it hits walls or the floor, but combines with itself into an omelette that acts as a mid stage fruit (like a toast slice).
Anyway, these 'fruits' can be put in another game mode, or maybe we have a "Classic Toast" game mode without them as an option.

SUIKA VALUES:
arena internal
width: 670
smaller height: 750
larger height: 846

spawn offset -22.5
wall thickness 20

to fall: 53/60 frames
846 height
868.5 = a*(53/60)^2
a = 111.3 works well

cherry + cherry = 1
strawberry + strawberry = 3
grape + grape = 6
orange + orange = 10
tomato + tomato = 15
apple + apple = 21
yuzu + yuzu = 28
peach + peach = 36
pineapple + pineapple = 45
honeydew + honeydew = 55
melon + melon = 66
